## Mission Statement

As a previous zen monk with over 15 years of experience in construction, I bring a diverse and user-centered approach to software engineering. My skills and experience allow me to seamlessly take feedback and improve my code, while also asking questions when needed. Paired with a love of technology, I also thrive on working in fast paced environments to build and improve applications.
